Study Case:
We have a gym, and we want to track how long each person spends their time in the gym.

1. We make a system that tracks the time each person enters and exits the gym.
2. By typing their name into the system, with the datetime, and of course, the time.
3. We track the time when the name is type into the system.
4. Also i will make database for user that already become a member, so that we can track our member!
